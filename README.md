# Ecommerce Sales Analysis SQL Project

## Project ##

This project showcases my ability to analyze and derive insights from an online eCommerce dataset using SQL. The project involves creating and managing an eCommerce database to explore sales trends, customer behavior, product performance, and inventory management. Through a series of SQL queries, I addressed key business questions, such as identifying top-selling products, analyzing customer orders, assessing sales performance across different categories and brands, and evaluating the contribution of different regions and supervisors to overall sales. This project is a practical demonstration of essential SQL skills, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis. 

## OBJECTIVE ##

- **Database:** Analyzed the dataset using the `PracticeDB` database.
- **Data Preparation:** Renamed the table from **`online-ecommerce`** to **`online_ecommerce`**. Converted the **`Order_Date`** column from text to a **`DATE`** data type, renaming it to **`Orders_Date`**.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted basic exploratory data analysis to gain an understanding of the dataset.
- **Data Analysis:** Executed SQL queries to answer specific business questions and extract insights from the eCommerce sales data.
